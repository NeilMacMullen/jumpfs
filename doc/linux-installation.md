# Installing for Linux

If you are installing for Linux runing on Windows, please follow the [WSL installation guide](wsl-installation.md)

If you are truly installing on "native" Linux then most of the installation flow for WSL also applies.  The differences are:

- you should obviously use a folder in the native filesystem to store the files!
- at the beginning of the **bash-jumpfs.sh** script you should replace the calls to wslvar and wslpath with simple assignments.
