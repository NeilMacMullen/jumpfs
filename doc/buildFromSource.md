# Building from source

You can build jumpfs from either Windows or Linux; if you are intending to use it from both environments on the same machine, you only need to build it once.


First, ensure that you have the [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.

## PowerShell
Run the **build.ps** script in the top *jumps* folder.

## Linux
Run the **build.sh** script in the top *jumps* folder.
* Note* that it is currently not possible to build the Windows executable from Linux.  If you use both PowerShell and Linux, you should build from PowerShell * 


## Artefacts

Binaries and scripts are available in the *publish* folder.
