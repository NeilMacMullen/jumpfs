You can build jumpfs from either Windows or Linux; if you are intending to use it from both environments on the same machine, you only need to build it once.


First, ensure that you have the [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.

## PowerShell

## Linux
Run the **build.sh** script in the top *jumps* folder.
